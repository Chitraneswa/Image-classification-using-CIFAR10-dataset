# Image-classification-using-CIFAR10-dataset
In this notebook, I am going to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes,frogs,horses and other objects. After preprocessing the images, I have trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.
